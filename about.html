    <h1>About The Tech Brief</h1>
    <p class="page-lead">The Tech Brief is an independent technology publication based in Dublin, Ireland. We cover the developments in artificial intelligence, enterprise technology, cybersecurity, broadcast media, and consumer gadgets that matter most to professionals and technology enthusiasts.</p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>Technology moves fast. The volume of news, product launches, research, and industry developments published every day makes it genuinely difficult to stay current without spending hours reading across dozens of publications. The Tech Brief solves that problem.</p>
    <p>Our editorial team monitors the technology landscape across five specialist areas — AI and machine learning, enterprise IT and cloud infrastructure, cybersecurity and threat intelligence, broadcast technology and media production, and mobile and consumer gadgets. We identify the stories that matter, provide clear and accurate summaries, and link directly to the full reporting so you can go deeper on the stories most relevant to you.</p>
    <p>Every story we feature is selected on the basis of its significance to our readership. We do not accept payment for story placement. Our editorial independence is fundamental to the trust readers place in us.</p>

    <h2>Our Editorial Standards</h2>
    <p>The Tech Brief is committed to accuracy, clarity, and transparency. We hold ourselves to the following standards across everything we publish:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Accuracy first.</strong> We verify the substance of every story we cover against the original reporting. If we cannot confirm a claim, we do not repeat it.</li>
      <li><strong>Source transparency.</strong> Every story we feature identifies its original source and links directly to the full article. We do not obscure where information comes from.</li>
      <li><strong>No sensationalism.</strong> We describe technology developments factually and proportionately. We do not exaggerate claims or manufacture urgency to drive clicks.</li>
      <li><strong>Clear corrections.</strong> If we publish inaccurate information, we correct it promptly and transparently. Corrections are noted in the relevant content.</li>
      <li><strong>Editorial independence.</strong> Our coverage decisions are made entirely on editorial merit. Advertisers and commercial partners have no influence over which stories we cover or how we cover them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What We Cover</h2>
    <p>Our coverage spans five specialist categories, each monitored by our editorial team and updated throughout the day:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>AI News:</strong> Developments in artificial intelligence, large language models, machine learning research, and the business and policy implications of AI adoption across industries.</li>
      <li><strong>Broadcast Technology:</strong> News from the broadcast engineering and media production industry, covering playout systems, cloud production, IP workflows, and the technology behind television and streaming.</li>
      <li><strong>Enterprise Technology:</strong> Cloud infrastructure, enterprise software, IT operations, and the technology decisions facing organisations at scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Threat intelligence, vulnerability disclosures, security research, and the defensive strategies protecting individuals and organisations.</li>
      <li><strong>Mobile &amp; Gadgets:</strong> Smartphone launches, wearable technology, tablets, and the consumer electronics that define how we live and work.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="editorial-process">How We Select Stories</h2>
    <p>Our team reviews technology coverage from a wide range of established publications every day. Stories are selected based on their significance to our readership, the quality and credibility of the original reporting, and their relevance to at least one of our five coverage categories.</p>
    <p>We prioritise stories that help our readers make better decisions — whether that is understanding a new technology, staying aware of a security threat, evaluating a product, or following a trend that will affect their work or life. We do not prioritise stories based on the profile of the publication they come from or any commercial relationship.</p>
