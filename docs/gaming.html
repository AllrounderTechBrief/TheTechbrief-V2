Arguable, until it's actually out, its existence is neither here nor there. But at the very least for the month of February, instead of talking at us lot in their monthly devlogs, developer Ion Lands opted to show off a little snippet of the game's opening moments to tide us over until release.</p>

          <p class="card-summary">The ongoing headache of RAMnarök has seen hardware prices rise and Valve's Steam Decks go out of stock in certain regions of the world.
